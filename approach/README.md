# approach README
## reiterating - the purpose of 90 days of zk
__streamline the process of getting to the bleeding edge of zk, by setting the adventurer up for the first 90 days.__
## the bulk of the approach
through some research and anecdotal experience, White Paper DAO feels that there is quite a simple way to get to the bleeding edge of _any_ field.

1. read the research 'idols' publish
2. listen to everything 'idols' say
3. ensure you understand everything to the point where you can predict the next sentence
4. build projects required to understand research and talks
5. solve small problems with the projects
#### note:
- 'idols' here refers to the adventurers who are currently at the bleeding edge in the field of interest.
- the word 'idols' has been used very deliberately. as someone beginning an adventure, questioning the insights/intuitions/research/work of an equally (if not more) intelligent adventurer who has spent the better part of years (if not decades) doing the very thing you are seeking to learn is not the best use of your time.
- __this is not in any shape or form a statement to silence questions or detriment innovation, the only point we try to make here is that when you are beginning something, it's highly unlikely that you have stumbled upon an insight that people working tirelessly in the field for years might have missed.__
- the goal is to become someone at the bleeding edge, the adventurer's real work begins there.
## 'idols' to follow for the next 90 days

## assumptions made about the adventurer's previous adventures
zk as an adventure may not be suited to the adventurer unfamiliar with the following concepts in depth
- A fair amount of math, networking, coding
- Web3
- Blockchain
- Common issues with L1 Blockchains
- L1 blockchains vs L2 blockchains

there's not much to worry about if you are unfamiliar with the concepts listed above, you can embark on those adventures (preferably in the order in which they are listed) and come back to this one.
