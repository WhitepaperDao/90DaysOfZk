## purpose of this repo
this repository was created to help the White Paper DAO document it's adventure of getting to the bleeding edge of zk, as well as serve as a reference point for others embarking on a similar adventure.
## approach
adventurers tend to have different learning styles, but most can be classified into a few overarching groups. this repository currently aims to help 2 of those groups, namely - learning by __building__ & learning by __studying__.

refer [approach README](/approach/README.md) for more.

a caveat to note would be that learning by building here refers to a learning style with more time spent on 'getting your hands dirty' while learning by studying refers to a learning style with more time spent on reading, research, podcasts and/or lectures.

this is not to say that either approach will not employ elements from the other, just a difference in allocated time shares.
### approach 0 - learning with an inclination on building
